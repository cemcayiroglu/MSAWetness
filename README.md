## Synopsis

A Java program that sorts all metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States by wettest population during May of 2015.  The population wetness of an MSA is calculated as the number of people in the MSA times the amount of rain received.  For the purposes of this exercise, assume that all people remain inside between the hours of 12 AM and 7 AM local time and so rainfall during these hours does not count.
